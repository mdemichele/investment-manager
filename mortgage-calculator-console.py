    # Basic Formula: M = P[r(1 + r) ^ n / (1 + r) ^ n - 1]
    
    # First, calculate the monthly interest rate from the annual interest rate
    # To do so: take annual_interest and divide by 12 
    monthly_interest = (annual_interest / 100) / 12
    
    # Second, calculate the total number of payments over the loan's lifetime
    # To do so: Take loan_length and multiply by 12
    total_payments = loan_length * 12
    
    # Third use the calculated values to get the dividend (top) and divisor (bottom) of the Formula
    dividend = monthly_interest * (1 + monthly_interest) ** total_payments
    divisor  = (1 + monthly_interest) ** total_payments - 1
    
    # Get the quotient by dividing the dividend by the divisor
